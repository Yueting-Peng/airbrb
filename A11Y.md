# A11Y Enhancements in AirBrB Application



- **Alt Text**: Images in the application have descriptive alt text. This ensures that users with visual impairments receive context and information about the images.
- **Semantic Elements**: I used semantic HTML elements like headings, lists, and landmarks to provide a meaningful structure for screen readers. In the development process, I strive to minimize the use of non-semantic tags like `<div>` and instead prioritize the use of semantic tags such as `<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`, `<aside>`, `<section>`, and others.
- Every time a user wants to delete a record, log out, or make a room reservation, a modal will appear to confirm the action, preventing users from making accidental decisions."
- **Default Values**: To enhance convenience and speed, I set reasonable default values in the form fields. For example, if a host want to change the information of their listings, their records are preserved in the form, allowing users to easily edit their listing.
- **Improved Labeling**: I refined labeling for form fields and interactive elements to provide more context and clarity.
- **Mouse Alternatives**: To accommodate situations where keyboard events might be inconvenient, we've implemented mouse-friendly alternatives. For example, in our form input fields, users can increase or decrease the quantity of guests, beds, bathrooms, bedrooms by clicking the up and down arrows located next to the input boxes.
