# UI/UX Considerations for AirBrB Application

This document outlines the UI/UX design principles and patterns applied in the development of the AirBrB application. My goal was to create an interface that is not only aesthetically pleasing but also user-friendly and intuitive.



- Grid System: I utilized a card-based grid layout that organizes property listings in a clean and scalable manner. This allows for a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes.

- Important actions like "Switch to hosting" and "Create a new listing" are prominently placed at the top for easy access.

- A light background with subtle use of color promotes a friendly and approachable environment.

- Listings are tagged with "PENDING" or "ACCEPTED," providing immediate status recognition.

- Icons are used to indicate favorites and provide a visual cue for reviews, maintaining consistency across the interface.

- A prominent search bar with filter options is provided, allowing users to quickly refine their search.

- Each listing card contains all the essential information at a glanceâ€”price, location, and reviews.

- To provide an immersive experience, I implemented a Carousel component for showcasing property images. Users can easily browse through multiple images, enhancing their ability to evaluate a listing's visual appeal.

- On the Hosting Page, I used a table to display all of the landlord's property information.

- All the components in my application are responsive and can adapt to screens as small as 400px. The left navigation bar on hosting page automatically hides on smaller screens and transforms into a drawer component.

- Every time a user wants to delete a record, log out, or make a room reservation, a modal will appear to confirm the action, preventing users from making accidental decisions.

- Convenient page design includes a house icon in the upper right corner that allows users to return to the homepage at any time. Additionally, both the login and registration pages feature buttons that enable users to switch between them.

- Every listing detail page I've presented utilizes an attractive grid layout to showcase up to five images of the details. The average star rating of my forms is visible on the default page of the search form.
