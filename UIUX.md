# UI/UX Considerations for AirBrB Application

This document outlines the UI/UX design principles and patterns applied in the development of the AirBrB application. My goal was to create an interface that is not only aesthetically pleasing but also user-friendly and intuitive.



- **Grid System**: I utilized a card-based grid layout that organizes property listings in a clean and scalable manner. This allows for a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes.
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Important actions like "Switch to hosting" and "Create a new listing" are prominently placed at the top for easy access.

- **Color Palette**: A light background with subtle use of color promotes a friendly and approachable environment.

- **Status Indicators**: Listings are tagged with "PENDING" or "ACCEPTED," providing immediate status recognition.
- **Consistent Iconography**: Icons are used to indicate favorites and provide a visual cue for reviews, maintaining consistency across the interface.

- **Search Functionality**: A prominent search bar with filter options is provided, allowing users to quickly refine their search.
- **Clear Information Display**: Each listing card contains all the essential information at a glanceâ€”price, location, and reviews.
- **Listing Images Carousel**: To provide an immersive experience, I implemented a Carousel component for showcasing property images. Users can easily browse through multiple images by swiping or clicking, enhancing their ability to evaluate a listing's visual appeal.

- On the Hosting Page, I used a table to display all of the landlord's property information.
- All the components in my application are responsive and can adapt to screens as small as 400px. The left navigation bar on hosting page automatically hides on smaller screens and transforms into a drawer component.
